## How to contribute with Pireal
Some ways to collaborate with the project

### Help with the code

* Report bugs, feature request and other issues in the [issue tracking](https://github.com/centaurialpha/pireal/issues) system.
* When a new version is released, you can create a package for different distributions (Debian, Arch, Fedora, etc).
* It helps create documentation.

### Embed your video like this:
{: .left}

{% highlight html linenos=table %}
<div class="icontain">
  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8yis7GzlXNM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

It'll play like this funny video below! Try resizing the page!

Photo layouts are also really cool and dynamically resizable. Check out the photos/gallery section at [magiciansanfrancisco.com](http://magiciansanfrancisco.com) for a demo and see [the source code](https://github.com/strongrobert/MagicianSanFrancisco) for how.
