Pireal is a tool that allows to evaluate queries written in the language of relational algebra and visualize the result of a particular query. All this from an intuitive interface.
Queries are made to a database. A database contains tables/relationships, both the database and the relationships can be created/edited from Pireal or from a text editor.

## Developed for students
It was intended for use during learning Relational Algebra.

## Cross-platform
The core is written in Python, the GUI is developed in Qt and QML. These tools work very well on any platform :).
